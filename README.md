## Functionality

This web app allows you to purchase and hold stocks (up to 5 at any one time) and track your performance over time. Each user will be given $100,000 to trade with and see how succesful they can be. The following information will be tracked

* Purchase Price
* Current Price
* Total Value of Stocks
* Unrealized Gain/Loss
* Total Value of Cash
* Total Account Value
* Transaction History

## Setup

### Repo Setup
Use [GitHub](https://github.com/minipele06/portfolio-dashboard) to clone the project repository for the Stock Market Simulator. Use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

>cd ~/Desktop/portfolio-dashboard

### Environment Setup
Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

>conda create -n portfolio-env python=3.7 # (first time only)

>conda activate portfolio-env

From within the virtual environment, install the required packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file:

>pip install -r requirements.txt

### AlphaVantage Setup
The program will need an API Key to issue requests to the [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/). Follow the link and signup for an account which will then issue you your individual API Key. You will then need to create a .env file to save your environment variable which should be labeled ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY.

>ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="abc123"

## Instructions
From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the web app from the command-line:

Mac
>FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

PC
>export FLASK_APP=web_app # first time, to set the env var
>flask run # subsequent times

If you receive a message stating the following:

>Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Then you have succesfully launched the web app. Go to you internet browser and enter the above address to access the app locally. If you would like to run this web app on an external server, you may do so through a host of different servers. Check out Professor Rossetti's page explaining in further detail how to proceed at the bottom [Web Servers](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/exercises/web-app/README.md). 

## Step-by-Step Guide

As stated above, once you receive a message in your terminal that the web app is running locally, you may then navigate to the local address.

### Home Page

The home page is the main landing page where it explains the basics of the web application and has a link to an about page which delves in to what needs the application is trying to meet.

#### Register

The registration box allows users who have never used the app to create an account.

* Email: An email is required to start your account. The program will validate that the provided email address includes an "@" symbol.

* Username: You may enter any username that you would like. However, duplicate usernames will not be permitted.

* Password: There are no password requirements other than there must be at least one character and can not be blank.

If any of the fields are empty, the program will give you an error message.

#### Login

The login box will authenticate users credentials. On a succesful authorization, users will be taken to their dashboard page.

If any of the fields are empty, the program will give you an error message.

The forgot password button is not currently functional and will only flash a warning message.

### About Page

The about page quickly delves in to the user needs that the program is intending to fulfill.

### Dashboard

The Dashboard page shows the user the current positions he/she holds. Additionally, it shows the current account cash value, stock value, and total account value.

The current positions table shows the individual stocks held, the price they were bought at, the current price (as of which it was last updated), the number of shares held, the total position value by stock, and the unrealized gain/loss on the stock. 

To update the market value of the stock portfolio, hit update market values. This will update the current price to the market and calculate the new total position value by stock and unrealized gain/loss on each stock as well as the new total stock value and total account value.

### Buy/Sell

The Trading Platform page is the hub for users to buy and sell stock. Stock tickers will be checked for the following validations:

* Must not contain numbers
* Must not exceed 4 characters
* Must not be blank

Symbols that do not represent a valid stock ticker but make it through the above validations will result in an improper request from the Alphavantage API which will lead to a danger message.

As stated in the introduction, users may only hold 5 different stocks at one time. They may purchase those same 5 stocks in a staggered fashion but must sell a stock before they can buy a new one. Additionally, each user begins with $100,000. Each purchase order will be compared with the available cash to validate whether the purchase can be made. 

Sell orders will be checked in a similar fashion and will additionally be required to already belong in your positions in order to be sold. The number of shares sold can also not exceed the amount that the user holds. 

Blank entries will return an invalid request.

### Transactions

The Transaction History Page keeps a log of all of the transactions that have occured in that account. Stock purchases are represented by a negative value (cash outflow) and stock sales are represented by a positive value (cash inflow).

### Logout

The logout page brings users back to the home page and requires them to log back in again before they are able to access their specific dashboard page again.

## Quality

The below screenshot shows the results of running the code through Code Climate in order to test the simplicity and maintainability of the code

## Minimum Viable Product

The following program was created as a minimum viable product and therefore is missing some functionality. Some of said missing functionality include:

* Forgot Password Reset
* Viewing Live Price before execution
* Email confirmation of trade
